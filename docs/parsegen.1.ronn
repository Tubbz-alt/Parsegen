parsegen(1) -- LL1 Parser Generator
===================================

## DESCRIPTION

Parsegen is a parser generator designed to make creating hand-editable top-down
parsers simple and easy. Parsegen automates the task of generating code to 
parse a given set of grammar symbols. These actions can be edited later by hand
or custom code to be executed when each symbol is parsed can be provided in a 
set of semantic actions defined in the host code.
